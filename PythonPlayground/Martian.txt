"You hear an alarm. Wind speeds gusting to 175kph. The mission is designed to handle sandstorm gusts of 150mph."

"what do I do?", "Call Houston?"
"call houston", "They advise you put on your flight suit and huddle in the middle of the Hab. They are worried about the Hab depressurising"




"put on flight suit", "You join the rest of the crew huddled in the middle of the Hab. 



"What is The Ares Program?", "The Ares Program. Mankind reaching out to Mars to send people to another planet."

"Who am I?", "Mark Watney. Member of the Ares 3 crew. The very lowest ranked member of the crew."

"What day is it?", "SOL 6"

"What is here?", "The Hab you live in and the MDV (Mars Descent Vehicle) outside."



SOL 6

The mission is designed to handle sandstorm gusts of 150kph.

Houston has got understandably nervous when we got whacked with 175 kph winds.

You are all in your flight space suits and huddled in the middle of the Hab, just in case it lost pressure. But the Hab wasn't the problem.

The MAV is a spaceship. 

You're pretty much fucked.

Six days into what should be the greatest two months of your life, and it's about to turn into a nightmare.

If you die here today. Maybe there'll be a day of national mourning for you, and your Wikipedia page will say, "Mark Watney is the only human being to have died on Mars."
